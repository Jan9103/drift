### Rules:

* Respect other projects licenses (aka no code stealing)
  * No AI written code (even ones which "did not steal data" - they lied about that before)

### Steps:

1. Check if your change is wanted (is a issue open and approved? does it fix a obvious bug? etc)
1. Avoid duplicating work (assign yourself on the issue, write a comment, or similar)
1. Implement it yourself (see rules)
1. Test your changes
1. Check if you have to update the documentation
1. Sort your commits (no 30 "fixup" or "a" commits please)
1. Open a github pull-request
